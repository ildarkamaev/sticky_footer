# Sticky Footer

Web page with Sticky footer

## WTF is this?

Based on Kevin Powell's video [Easy sticky footer - stop a footer from floating up a short page!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc2olxLgKLk)  
I built a webpage with a footer that sticks to the bottom of the page.

## What was used
* HTML5 & CSS3
* SASS

## What I learned
* How to create a sticky footer that keeps to the bottom of the page no matter how much content is on the page
* The use of margin-top: auto

## Problems/Mistakes
* The height of 100% on html element is important for this to work



## License

Pretty much use it however you like.
